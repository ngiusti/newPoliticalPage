                    My name is Nicholas Giusti, I am a web developer and designer. I was a chemist for about 3 years of my life before I figured out the I had a passion for code and design work. With my spare time I tought myself how to code and understand the fundimentals of design. Though a few years of hard work and understanding I have found a job and have decided to use my skills for freelance work.

                    This is where my relationship with people comes in, I enjoy taking the time to get to know what somebody wants and needs and through this creating a webpage that is truly theirs and what they enjoy. I enjoy good design and quality web pages, this is what I hope to bring to you. If you are in need of a webpage for your upcoming politial race I would love to chat with you.
