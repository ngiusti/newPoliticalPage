                <p class="section__copy biography__copy">I’m Bill Jefferson, and I want to serve our community as our next County Commissioner. I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, and earned my BS in accounting from Brigham Young University. During college, I served as a missionary in Honduras, where I learned to speak fluent Spanish. After college, I worked as a CPA for Deloitte in Columbus, Ohio, for six years. I then went on to the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business to earn my MBA and met my wife Helen. Helen and I decided to make our home here in Washington County with our three young sons, Abner, Brett, and Charlie. We started Jefferson and Jefferson, LLP and grew our business to include twenty-five employees. As a small business owner, I know the power of a great team and the value of leading with principle. And as our next County Commissioner, I will lead our community to a stronger, healthier, and more prosperous future. A vote for Bill Jefferson is a vote for smaller government, lower taxes, and better services for Washington County.</p>
